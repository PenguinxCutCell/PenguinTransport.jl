# Todo

- [ ] Implement the two-phase transport system with interface constraints is just flux continuity, i.e. no jump conditions on the solution itself (first order pde)
- [ ] Review the closure `Tγ_full = Tω_full`. This is not a physical closure. the correct one is Impose T only where u⋅n<0. Nowhere else. classical for scalar advection equation.
